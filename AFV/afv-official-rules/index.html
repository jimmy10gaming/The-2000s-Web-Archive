(“Network” or “ABC”).  At Producer and/or Network’s sole discretion, videos may also be posted on ABC.com and may be further used as stated herein or in the submission materials.  Only videos conforming to Network’s Broadcast Standards and Practices, based on Producer’s and Network’s judgment, as they determine in their sole discretion, will be eligible for consideration in the Contest.<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
The Contest will consist of approximately eighteen (18) Contestant shows, three (3) One Hundred Thousand Dollar prize shows, and one (1) Grand Prize award show in the 2012 – 2013 season.  In each Contestant show, there will be a first, second and third prize awarded for best videos.  The 18 Contestant shows will be divided into 3 blocks. Each block will consist of between 5 and 7 Contestant shows, and will be followed by a One Hundred Thousand Dollar prize show, which will feature the first place winners from each of the Contestant shows in the corresponding block of Contestant shows.  The Grand Prize award show at the end of the season will feature a competition between the three (3) One Hundred Thousand Dollar prize show winners from the 2012 – 2013 season.  There will be one (1) prize awarded for the best video in the Grand Prize show. The number of videos per show and/or shows per block are subject to change in Producer’s sole discretion.  If the 2012 – 2013 season series is unable to be completed due to forces beyond Producer’s control, such as cancellation or a guild strike, Producer reserves the right not to award any or all of the prizes set forth above.
