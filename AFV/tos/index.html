<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>1. Content</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All content, excluding materials where authorship is clearly attributed to AFV (e.g., AFV&#8217;s blogs and news pages), is created by our members and AFV takes no responsibility for the accuracy of reviews and other information. The community is self-policing. We encourage our members to research the site and to report inappropriate content and any advertising language (commercial solicitation). At no time should a member post advertising content on their or others&#8217; profiles. Violating this rule could result in your profile being permanently deleted. Inappropriate content should be immediately reported to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130327011714/mailto:help@AFV.com">help@AFV.com</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are a variety of places on the AFV website where members can post reviews, ratings, comments, and other content. Content should be honest and not defamatory or disparaging and should not infringe upon the intellectual property rights of third parties. Any form of spam or commercial solicitation is strictly prohibited. AFV reserves the right to remove or edit content as it deems necessary in its sole discretion.

The community is self-policing, and inappropriate content can be reported at any time to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130327011714/mailto:help@AFV.com">help@AFV.com</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All trademarks, slogans, service marks, trade names, and trade dress are proprietary to AFV, VDBP and/or our partners, affiliates, licensors or licensees. We may change the site or delete content or features at any time, in any way, for any reason. Except as we specifically agree in writing, no content from the site may be used, reproduced, transmitted, distributed or otherwise exploited in any way other site as part of the site, not even as part of a derivative work, except that where the site is configured to enable the download of particular content, you may download one copy of such content to a single computer for your personal, noncommercial home use only, provided that you (a) keep intact all copyright and other proprietary notices, (b) make no modifications to, and do not rent, lease, loan, sell, distribute, copy (except to create a single copy for your own back-up purposes), or create any derivative works based on the site or the content, in whole or in part, and (c) do not use the content in an unlawful manner or in a manner that suggests an association with any of AFV&#8217;S, VDBP&#8217;s and/or Fishbowl Worldwide Media&#8217;s or their partners&#8217; or affiliates&#8217; products, services or brands. Any business use, &#8220;re-mailing&#8221; or high-volume or automated use of the site is prohibited.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the event that we offer downloads of software on the site and you download such software, the software, including any files, images incorporated in or generated by the software, and data accompanying the software (collectively, the &#8220;Software&#8221;) are licensed to you by us or third-party licensors for your limited, personal, noncommercial home use only. We do not transfer title to the Software to you. Except as permitted under applicable law, you may not distribute or otherwise exploit the Software or decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble, adapt it, or otherwise reduce the Software to a human-readable form, except to the extent permitted by applicable law. More details on AFV&#8217;s disclaimers and warranties regarding any Software may be found at Paragraph 6, below.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In these terms of use, we use the word &#8220;content&#8221; to mean text, messages, ideas, concepts, pitches, suggestions, stories, screenplays, treatments, formats, artwork, photographs, drawings, videos, audiovisual works, musical compositions (including lyrics), sound recordings, characterizations, your and/or other persons&#8217; names, likenesses, voices, usernames, profiles, actions, appearances, performances and/or other biographical information or material, and/or other similar materials that are submitted, posted, uploaded, embedded, displayed, distributed, communicated or otherwise added to the site.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are two types of content: Solicited Content and Unsolicited Content. &#8220;Solicited Content&#8221; means content (a) that we expressly request or enable you to provide to us via any feature or activity on the site for our review or display and/or distribution and possible specifically defined consideration or compensation explicitly offered by us (collectively, &#8220;Consideration&#8221;) (such as prizes or other value in games, sweepstakes, contests and promotions, or the chance to have your content featured on our television program(s)); or (b) that you add to the site for which you do not seek Consideration. See below in Paragraph 3 for the special rules and conditions that apply to all contests, including the contest conducted through &#8220;America&#8217;s Funniest Home Videos.&#8221; &#8220;Unsolicited Content&#8221; is any and all content that does not fall within subparagraphs (a) or (b) of this paragraph.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our long-standing company policy does not allow us to accept or consider Unsolicited Content so please do not add Unsolicited Content to the site. We want to avoid the possibility of future misunderstandings when projects developed by us or under our direction might seem to others to be similar to their own creative work. We therefore ask that you not add any Unsolicited Content. In any event, you agree that any content you add is not being made in confidence or trust and that no confidential or fiduciary relationship is intended or created between you and us in any way, and that you have no expectation of any review, compensation or consideration of any type (other than any stated Consideration).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Except as expressly stated in these terms of use, the provisions of these terms of use apply equally to Unsolicited Content and Solicited Content. Accordingly, we, our licensees, distributors, agents, representatives and other authorized users shall be entitled to exploit and disclose all content for all purposes as set forth below, and we shall not be liable to you or to any person claiming through you for any exploitation or disclosure of any content.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2. Perpetual Royalty-Free, Worldwide License</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By adding content to the site you are transferring ownership of the content to VDBP. Said transfer gives VDBP the exclusive, fully-paid, royalty-free, licensable and transferable (in whole or part) worldwide right, title and interest in and to this content and the fully-paid, royalty-free, licensable and transferable (in whole or part) worldwide license to all embedded third-party copyrights, trademarks, patents, trade secrets, privacy and publicity rights and other intellectual and industrial property rights you own or control to use, reproduce, transmit, display, exhibit, distribute, index, comment on, modify, create derivative works based upon, perform and otherwise exploit such content, in whole or in part, in all media formats and channels now known or hereafter devised (including on websites, cable and broadcast television networks and stations, on broadband and wireless platforms, products and services, on physical media, and in theatrical release) for any and all purposes including, without limitation, entertainment, news, advertising, promotional, marketing, publicity, trade or commercial purposes, all without further notice to you or the foregoing third-party(ies), with or without attribution, and without the requirement of any permission from or payment to you or to any other person or entity. This transfer and grant of rights is perpetual, irrevocable, and transferable by VDBP, and grants VDBP, AFV and their affiliates, and sub-licensees the exclusive right to display, reproduce, edit, modify, adapt, publish, translate, and distribute this content nationally and internationally and in any media with or without the name associated with this content or any other form of attribution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Further to the foregoing, VDBP grants to you a limited, nontransferable, noncommercial, personal use license for the purpose of personal use, including using the content in your personal social networking account(s) online (which should be set to &#8220;private&#8221;). This personal use license permits your use of the content in connection with no more than one (1) account per social networking site. This license does not in any way permit you to license, sell, transfer, or otherwise commercialize the content with any third-party, including without limitation exhibiting and/or distributing the content except as described in this paragraph, and/or using the content or any portion thereof as a submission to any third-party contests.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By adding content, you represent and warrant that the content and your addition thereof to the website conform to the requirements of these terms of use and that you own or have all the necessary rights, licenses, consents and permissions, including consents and permissions from any third parties appearing in the content and/or contributing to it, without the need for any permission from or payment to any other person or entity, to exploit, and to authorize us to exploit, such content in all manners contemplated by these terms of use (including the foregoing license). These terms of use (including the foregoing license) do not limit any past or future grant of rights, consents, agreements, assignments and waivers you may have made or make with respect to content.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To the extent that any content you add to the site contains original songs or recordings, you hereby represent that you are either a member of ASCAP, BMI, SESAC or other applicable mechanical performing rights and/or copyright owners&#8217; society and that you have the right to license to us, all musical compositions (including lyrics) and the sound recordings, or otherwise the sound recordings contained in such content are available for licensing to us (and our licensees, distributors, agents, representatives and other authorized users) directly from such societies, or that you otherwise may grant us all such rights. Notwithstanding the foregoing, regardless of whether you are a member of any rights society, you grant the foregoing license and rights with respect to each and every musical composition in which you have the authority or right to grant us such rights (including lyrics) and sound recordings contained in such content. In the event you cannot grant us such rights to the sound recordings you agree that we may remove the content from the site or alter the content to remove the sound recordings at our sole election.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To the extent that we solicit content through features or activities on or through the site (including games, sweepstakes, contests, promotions and the like) that require the use of our copyrighted works (in whole or in part), we hereby grant you a non-exclusive license to create a derivative work using our copyrighted works (in whole or in part) as required (but only as required, and only for the purpose of creating your content); provided however, that such license shall be conditioned upon your assignment of all rights in the work you create to us. If such rights are not assigned to us, your license to create derivative works using our copyrighted works (in whole or in part) shall be null and void.

<p><strong>a. JURISDICTIONAL AND VENUE ISSUES; GOVERNING LAW</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Subject to the requirements of applicable consumer rights and other laws, you agree that any action at law or in equity arising out of or relating to these terms of use or the site shall be filed, and that venue properly lies, only in state or federal courts located in Los Angeles, California, United States of America, and you hereby consent and submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts for the purposes of litigating any such action. We make no representation that content on the site is appropriate or available for use in any particular location.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Subject to the requirements of applicable consumer rights and other laws, these terms of use shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California and the laws of the United States, without giving effect to any principles of conflicts of law. If any provision of these terms of use shall be unlawful, void or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from these terms of use and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These terms of use take effect as an agreement and separately as a notice, which limits the basis on which AFV makes the site available. No waiver of any provision of these terms of use by us shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such provision or any other provision, and our failure to assert any right or provision under these terms of use shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.

Please note that, at all times, you are responsible for updating your personal information to provide us your current e-mail address. In the event that the last e-mail address that you have provided us is not valid, or for any other reason is not capable of delivering to you the notice described above, our dispatch of the e-mail containing such notice will nonetheless constitute effective notice of any amendment described in the notice.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>10. Claims of Copyright Infringement</strong></p>

* A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We may at our election give you notice that we have removed or disabled access to certain material by means of a general notice on the site, electronic mail to a user&#8217;s e-mail address in our records, or by written communication sent by first-class mail to your physical address in our records.

* Identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled, and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or access to it was disabled;<br/>
* A statement from you under the penalty of perjury, that you have a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled; and<br/>
* Your name, physical address and telephone number, and a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of a court for the judicial district in which your physical address is located, or if your physical address is outside of the United States, for any judicial district in which AFV and/or Fishbowl Worldwide Media may be found, and that you will accept service of process from the person who provided notification of allegedly infringing material or an agent of such person.</p>
