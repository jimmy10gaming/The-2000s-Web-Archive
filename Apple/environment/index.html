						<p class="intro">Protecting the environment is critical to the conservation of precious natural resources and the continued health of our planet. Apple recognizes its responsibility as a global citizen and continually strives to reduce the environmental impact of the work we do and the products we&nbsp;create.</p>
						
						<h3>Apple and your carbon footprint</h3>
						<p>Apple is constantly working to minimize our impact on the environment. We learned that the best way to do this is to make our products more energy efficient and environmentally friendly.</p>
						
						<p>In October 2008, Apple began providing customers with estimates of the greenhouse gas emissions generated by each new product sold. For example, manufacturing and using a MacBook — our most popular notebook — results in 460 kg of CO<sub>2</sub>e emissions over four years of use. According to the EPA, that's about the same amount the average car emits in a month. </p>

						<p>Apple’s Environment team arrived at this estimate using a sophisticated life-cycle analysis of carbon emissions at each phase of production, starting with the mining of raw materials. We account for the manufacturing of the product as well as its packaging. Then we add the emissions related to transporting it to market, the power consumed during the product’s use, and the energy required for eventual recycling. Apple also factors in the environmental impact of our offices and other business operations, which account for about 5% of total emissions.</p>

						<p>The Fraunhofer Institute in Germany, a leader in the field of life cycle analysis, verified our methodology. We believe it has resulted in the broadest possible measure of the carbon footprint for each of our new products.</p>

						<p>No other electronics company reports this information at the product level, so it’s impossible to compare the carbon footprint for each of our new products with those of our competitors. If other manufacturers were to provide the same data, we are confident that Apple's products would stack up very well. For starters, Apple offers superior power management right out of the box — every Mac we ship is ENERGY STAR 4.0 compliant, or better, as a standard feature.</p>

						<p>We have taken the innovative step of reporting emissions on a per-product basis so customers can make informed decisions about their own carbon footprints. Customers can also track our progress in reducing carbon emissions each time a new product is introduced.</p>

						<p>This emissions data, along with detailed information on energy efficiency and materials composition, is provided for each new product in our Product Environmental Reports. You can find these reports, as well as information about the reduction programs we’ve put in place to minimize the carbon footprint of everyday operations, at Apple’s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090701090145/http://www.apple.com/environment/resources/environmentalperformance.html">Environmental Performance</a> page.</p>

							<h2>Latest in Apple and the Environment</h2>
							<p>Apple is on track to eliminate toxic chemicals from our products. In the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090701090145/http://www.apple.com/environment/update/">2008 Environmental Update,</a> Steve Jobs provides an overview of Apple’s progress to eliminate mercury and arsenic from displays and brominated flame retardants (BFRs) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) from internal components. Steve Jobs also talks about Apple’s policy on climate change, steps taken to improve product energy efficiency, and overall recycling performance during 2007.</p>

					<div class="tabcontent active" id="achievements">
						<p>At Apple, our commitment to the environment is second nature. Here are just a few of our recent achievements:</p>
						<ul class="square">
							<li>MacBook, MacBook Pro, and MacBook Air have highly recyclable aluminum and glass enclosures, mercury-free displays and arsenic-free display glass.  Printed circuit boards, electrical components, mechanical parts, and internal cables are BFR-free and PVC-free.</li> 
							</li>
							<li>The MacBook family is designed to be energy efficient. For example, a 13-inch MacBook consumes only 14W in idle with the display on, less than a quarter of the consumption of a typical household 60W lightbulb, and far exceeds ENERGY STAR requirements.</li>
							<li>Energy-efficient LED display technology now ships with MacBook, MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, and the LED Cinema Display. The MacBook LED backlit display uses 30% less power compared to conventional CCFL-backlit displays.</li> 
							<li>Between the first-generation and current-generation iMac, sleep-mode energy usage has decreased 93% thanks to improvements in CPU power management and increased hardware efficiency.</li>
							<li>The packaging for the fourth-generation iPod nano is 32% lighter and uses 54% less volume than the packaging for the first-generation iPod nano.</li>
							<li>Apple products are compliant with the European Directive on the Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment, also known as the RoHS directive. Examples of materials restricted by RoHS include lead, mercury, cadmium, hexavalent chromium, and PBB and PBDE flame retardants. As a result of our proactive approach to hazardous substances, Apple met many of the RoHS requirements long before the July 2006 deadline.</li>
						</ul>
						<div class="tabsbottom"></div>
					</div>
					<div class="tabcontent" id="history">
						<p>Year after year, Apple has set and met important goals to phase out environmentally harmful substances, create recycling programs worldwide, and improve energy efficiency. Here are some of the most important milestones in our quest for environmental responsibility:</p>
