      Every Monday for two and a half years, Nintendo has introduced new 
      downloadable games and applications for the Wii console. Today marks a 
      milestone for the Virtual Console section of the Wii Shop Channel, home 
      of some of the greatest titles in video game history. The classic The 
      Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask becomes the 300th Virtual Console title 
      available for download. It's one of the highest-rated Nintendo 64 games 
      of all time, and its three-day time cycle and deeper, darker storyline 
      offer players a different experience than a traditional Zelda game. 
      People who played it years ago can relive their gaming roots, while 
      those who never picked it up can discover its fun and charm for the 
      first time.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0">
      Not to be overlooked, the second Art Style puzzle game for Nintendo 
      DSiWare makes its debut, along with the WiiWare games CRYSTAL DEFENDERS 
      R2 from SQUARE ENIX and Silver Star Chess from Agetec, Inc.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0">
      <b>Virtual Console</b><br/><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090521093335/http://www.nintendo.com/wii/virtualconsole/games/detail/7OfVrKE-E5ri9Rjnqx9FBs0gIzJGZtns">The 
      Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask </a>(Nintendo 64, 1 player, Rated E for 
      Everyone - Cartoon Violence, 1,000 Wii Points): Link must save the 
      world! This time, he finds himself trapped in Termina, an alternate 
      version of Hyrule that is doomed to destruction in just three short 
      days. Link must race to recover the Ocarina of Time (which allows him to 
      manipulate time in multiple ways), defeat challenging bosses in dungeons 
      spread across Termina and discover the key to the mystery of Majora's 
      Mask. Along the way, he'll obtain new weapons and items and help other 
      characters (some strangely familiar) in their everyday lives. In 
      addition, Link must use a wide assortment of masks scattered throughout 
      Termina, each with its own specific use or power. Never before have 
      three days offered so much in the way of action, mind-boggling puzzles 
      and depth. The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask is an adventure unlike any 
      other!

    <p style="margin-top: 0">
      <b>Nintendo DSiWare</b><br/><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090521093335/http://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/UVeE-6vfX_TN90n3VWF_X5miNkyRWN93">Art 
      Style: PiCTOBiTS</a> (Nintendo, 1 player, Rated E for Everyone, 500 
      Nintendo DSi Points): Your goal in Art Style: PiCTOBiTS is simple: clear 
      large blocks that fall from above (&quot;megabits&quot;) by combining them with 
      &quot;bits&quot; (square blocks) of the same color. Add in the ability to pick up 
      bits and place them anywhere on the touch screen, and you'll quickly 
      find that strategy is critical to your success. By clearing the bits, 
      you gradually reveal each stage's hidden game character - look for 
      favorites from classic NES titles - and earn coins that can be spent to 
      unlock DARK stages or to listen to the game's soundtrack in MUSIC mode. 
      This grand mix of familiar elements and new game play leads to the 
      uniquely enjoyable experience that is PiCTOBiTS.

      <b>WiiWare</b><br/><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090521093335/http://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/Fv_uz3aN17tNiT7T8U93gP6FbvWFq128">CRYSTAL 
      DEFENDERS R2</a> (SQUARE ENIX, 1 player, Rated E for Everyone - Mild 
      Fantasy Violence, 800 Wii Points): In CRYSTAL DEFENDERS R2, you must 
      deploy various units, such as Fencers and Black Mages, to stop waves of 
      encroaching monsters from escaping the area with your party's crystals. 
      There are many types of units to choose from: Some specialize in 
      powerful short-range attacks, some wield far-reaching magicks and still 
      others are equipped with bows, enabling them to bring down aerial foes. 
      Deploy units in strategic locations to take full advantage of their 
      traits. Each time an enemy breaches your defenses and reaches a map's 
      exit, your party will lose crystals. When all your crystals are gone, 
      the game is over. CRYSTAL DEFENDERS R2 offers several new, challenging 
      maps containing multiple entrances and exits. It also introduces three 
      varieties of Power Crystals, allowing you to enhance the abilities of 
      your units, while new jobs, including Flintlock and Tinker, set the 
      stage for even more complex strategies. Can you defend all the maps 
      without losing a single crystal?<br/><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090521093335/http://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/N73_7oVJiMvsLmRKsflv51-SAeFbd8Mq">Silver 
      Star Chess</a> (Agetec, Inc., 1-2 players, Rated E for Everyone - Mild 
      Suggestive Themes, 500 Wii Points): Silver Star Chess has two modes: 
      1-Player and 2-Player. 1-Player mode allows you to play a chess match 
      against the computer opponent. 2-Player mode allows you to play against 
      another person. In 1-Player mode, you can select one of five different 
      computer opponents, as well as turn the background music off, adjust 
      sound effects and access in-game help features. Also, during the match, 
      you can redo your last move, save the game at any point or resign from 
      the game. After the match has ended, you can review each move made 
      during the match. While reviewing the match in this way, you can resume 
      that match at any point.<br/>
