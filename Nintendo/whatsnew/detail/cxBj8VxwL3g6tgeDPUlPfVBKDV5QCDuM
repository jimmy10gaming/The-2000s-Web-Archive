      This week's downloadable game releases include a spellbinding new 
      installment in the FINAL FANTASY series. This first true sequel to FINAL 
      FANTASY IV is sure to get RPG fans' blood pumping. Nintendo DSiWare 
      users will find a challenging new puzzle game to help keep their minds 
      spinning. A slick new poker title from the WiiWare service raises the 
      stakes for virtual card sharps, while the Virtual Console debut of a 
      classic Commodore 64 game puts players in pursuit of precious gems. With 
      so much variety on the Wii Shop Channel and Nintendo DSi Shop, your odds 
      of having a humdrum summer are getting slimmer by the hour.

      Mighty Flip Champ? Take control of Alta and page-flip through a series 
      of action-packed mazes. The touch screen reflects a preview of the next 
      chamber and shows Alta's projected destination within it. When it's time 
      to flip, use Alta's Magical Warp Wand to replace her world with the next 
      one. Will she land safely on solid ground or be crushed under it? By 
      cycling endlessly through room after brain-busting room, you'll match 
      wits with some of the most devious traps in puzzle/platforming history.

      Boulder Dash is one of the big computer-game classics. It is one of the 
      very few computer games ever to be ported from home computers to 
      arcades, not the other way around. The hero of the game is the brave 
      prospector Rockford. He must dig through caves to collect diamonds while 
      avoiding various types of dangerous creatures and obstacles such as 
      falling rocks. He is in constant danger of being crushed or trapped by 
      an avalanche or killed by an underground explosion. Strategy and 
      planning are the keys to mastering Boulder Dash. Once enough jewels have 
      been collected, the door to the mysterious escape tunnel is revealed and 
      Rockford can explore another cave.
