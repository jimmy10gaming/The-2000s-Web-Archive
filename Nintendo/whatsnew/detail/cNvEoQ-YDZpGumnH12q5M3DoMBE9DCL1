      With summer just around the corner, this Monday finds an especially hot 
      mix of downloadable game offerings for the WiiWare and Nintendo DSiWare 
      services, as well as for the Virtual Console. Nintendo DSi users can 
      become world-famous pop stars or use a new photo application to view 
      their pictures in interesting new ways. Wii owners can transform into 
      bubble-bursting dragons or hunt for melons on a mysterious island. And 
      be sure to check out this week's Virtual Console debut, which features 
      clay figures and stop-action animation to create a comedic twist to the 
      street fighting genre.
