      <b>Health and Safety Precautions</b>
      <br/><br/>
      We know that your child's safety and well-being are very
      important to you. While playing video games is generally a
      very safe activity, it's a good idea to be informed of the
      precautions you and your family should take while using your
      Nintendo system. Use the links below to read the Health and
      Safety Precautions manuals that are included with our systems (you
      can even download a PDF, to printout, for the Nintendo GameCube
      and Game Boy systems).
