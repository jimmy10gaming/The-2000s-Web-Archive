            <b>Connection Problems</b><br/>
            Nintendo.com is hosted on a very robust server farm and is rarely, if ever, completely unavailable. Please be aware that there are many factors that go into a satisfactory Internet experience, including the performance of your computer and modem, the performance of your Internet Service Provider's infrastructure and even the level of traffic on the Internet. At Nintendo.com we do our best to provide a fun and functional web site but we cannot be responsible for the operation of other Internet variables.
